# PyNativeAPI: A Simple JSON Server for Time.com Stories

This project is a lightweight web server built entirely with **Python's built-in libraries**.  
It requires **no external dependencies** and fetches the latest stories from [Time.com](https://time.com) using their **GraphQL API**.  
The server responds with a **JSON object containing the latest 6 stories**.
This projects demonstrates my skill to use 3rd Party API to extract data from it  and perform operations on them.
